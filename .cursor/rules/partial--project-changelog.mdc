# Changelog Guidelines

## Version Management

Document all changes in `CHANGELOG.md` following semantic versioning principles. Each development session should be documented under a new minor version, with patches for incremental changes within the session.

### Version Structure

- Major version (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- Minor version (0.X.0): New features and significant updates
- Patch version (0.0.X): Bug fixes and minor changes

### Documentation Format

```markdown

### Best Practices

1. Place newer changes and latest versions at the top of the file
2. Create a new minor version for each development session
3. Use patch versions for incremental changes within a session
4. Include date stamps for each version
5. Categorize changes under appropriate sections:
   - Added: New features
   - Changed: Updates to existing functionality
   - Deprecated: Features to be removed
   - Removed: Features that were removed
   - Fixed: Bug fixes
   - Security: Security vulnerability fixes
